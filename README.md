# 16-Hour Game Camp: Instructor's Guide
A curriculum for a 16-hour coding camp. 

This is basically broken into eight 100-minute sessions. Why 100 instead of 120? Because. Also, you can get a lot done in 800 minutes.

Okay, better answer: because we're budgeting that 1/6 of your time will go to breaks, kids arriving late, unexpected technical issues, and since we try to do this with at **least** 60% lab time, the kids can just crank away on the last lab(s) if you finish up a bit early.

The course will alternate between game creation and game discussion. The goal is that the kids will walk away having made two mini games AND having a better understanding of what makes a game good, not just how to put images on a screen and move them around in a gamelike way.
