# Session 1: Instructor's Notes

[Looking for the student guide?](README.md)

First and foremost, read the student guide. Most things are explained there. Here you'll find extra insights, troubleshooting tips, and other useful stuff.

## Steps in the lesson

* Get them signed up with Play Canvas (10 minutes)
  * Why 10 minutes? Because some kids won't remember their email address or their email password or will need some sort of help getting getting one... No matter what you tell them to prepare, some won't. 
    If you're a teacher, you know this from experience. 
    If you're a tech pro, jumping in to teach something fun, *everything* will take longer than you think. 
* Play a Demo Game (10 minutes)
  * They'll play "[Keepy Up](https://playcanv.as/p/XtfZXpxU/)." You try to keep the ball in the air. This is the game for their "[Making a Simple Game](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/tutorials/keepyup-part-one/)" tutorial. Help them find it and let them play it.
* Discuss the Demo Game (10-15 minutes)
  * Ask them questions about how hard it was to figure out how to play?
  * Were there any surprises?
  * Did they like it? What did they like?
* Learning 3D - Tutorial 1
  * Before they get into the game tutorial, they need to learn some of the basics.
