## Let's get signed up

The first step here is to get signed up with [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com). You'll need an email address and you'll need to pick a password. If you have a GMail account that isn't a school account, you can use that to login.

PlayCanvas will provide all the software tools we'll need for this course in the browser.

## Once you're signed up and logged in...

The top of the screen will have a tab titled "Explore." Click it and you can explore a number of games created with PlayCanvas. The one we're going to try is called "[Keepy Up.](https://playcanv.as/p/XtfZXpxU/)"

![Keepy Up Title Screen](../Resources%20and%20Assets/tutorial_images/keepy_up_open_screen_1.jpg)
